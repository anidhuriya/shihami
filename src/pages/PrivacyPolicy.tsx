            NFTs are individual tokens with valuable information stored in them.
            Because they hold a value primarily set by the market and demand,
            they can be bought and sold just like other physical types of art.
            NFTs unique data makes it easy to verify and validate their
            ownership and the transfer of tokens between owners. What You Need
            to Know. NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a
            blockchain and cannot be replicated. NFTs can represent real-world
            items like artwork and real estate. Tokenizing these real-world
            tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more
            efficient while reducing the probability of fraud.
